# NestedSampling_DMD
This python package explores how the measured rotation curve of the Milky Way galaxy constraints the dark matter density distribution in our galaxy.  Of particular interest are the variations in the dark matter density at the location of the earth.

Package Manual:

model.ipynb : shows the contents where we import our package, load our test data, do some inference using our model, and show some plots.

testdmdcode.py : test the code 

nsdmd/model.py : the module for our model



========to do ===== 

-1- model.ipynb: 
describes the model better 
describes the function better: we can use the comments inside the function to describes the function 

-2- tutorial. ipynb: 
polish it up 
add [new rotational curve] to display 


-3- model.py: 
add [new rotational curve] to function 


-4- date set: 
organize the data set better 


-5- readme: 
polish up readme 


-6- others: 
look at the pull request
use it to upgrade the package 


-7- UPGRADE THE CODE 

-8- figure out what need to be done for the comparision part 



-9- final check: nosetests & run set up
